Here is how you play the game...

-A block of characters will show up on the screen - this is the display of
a computer you must hack in to.
-Within the characters there will be some words; one of these words 
is the password.
-You have 4 attempts to guess the password, but each time you guess you will 
be told how many of the letters in your guess were in the right position.
-You can remove dud passwords or regain your lives by identifying one of 
the hints.
-Hints are random characters that are enclosed by a type of brackets, an 
example clue would be: (%*/$<) because it is enclosed by '()'.

Type 'Ready' to play, or 'Back' to return to the menu.
