# year1-fallout-terminal-game
This repository contains my first year Python project I completed at the end of term one.  
This project was for the Foundations of Comp & Tech module's programming section.    
It was an attempt to recreate the Fallout game series' terminal hacking mini-game.  
An example of the finished product can be seen below:
